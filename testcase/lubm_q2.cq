%- This query increases in complexity: 3 classes and 3 properties are involved. Additionally, there is a triangular pattern of relationships between the objects involved.

ans(X, Y, Z) :- inst(X, "GraduateStudent"), inst(Y, "University"), inst(Z, "Department"), tripe(X, "memberOf",Z), triple(Z, "subOrganizationOf", Y),
